    "Improved performance: The Data API uses advanced techniques like prefetching, parallelism, and data pipeline optimization to load and preprocess data faster than traditional Python data loading methods.\n",
    "Greater flexibility: The Data API provides a range of powerful features like shuffling, batching, and filtering that make it easy to customize your data pipeline to suit your needs.\n",
